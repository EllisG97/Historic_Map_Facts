TO DO:  

-Add background to text so it's not directly displaying on a map (eye-sore)  
-Fix Countries with multiple landmasses not displaying necessary information  
-Add data to remaining countries via .JSON  (O to S Remaining)  
-Fix top-right map selection box dimensions (Current selection box is too big for the smaller map display)
